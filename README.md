# Market_study
La poule qui chante, a French agri-food company that wants to expand internationally.

International, yes, but for now, the field of possibilities is very broad: no country or continent in particular has been chosen for now. All countries are possible!

Currently, our objective is to propose an initial analysis of the groupings of countries that we can target to export our chickens. We will then deepen the market study.
